Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow and Keras

This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) using TensorFlow and Keras with the VGG19 model. NST is a technique for blending the content of one image with the style of another image, creating a visually appealing combination.

Introduction

Neural Style Transfer (NST) involves the use of deep neural networks to transfer the style of one image onto another image. This project utilizes the VGG19 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to extract the content and style features from images.
Features

    Use of VGG19 model for feature extraction
    Customizable content and style weight parameters
    Option to save and display intermediate results
    Easy-to-use command-line interfac
